Hi, my name is Oscar Llerena. I learned how to transfer information from one point to another, mainly 
wirelessly, and now I am learning how to process it, secure it, and extract value
from it. I have participated in projects along the full stack of the information flow.
I hope you enjoy and get benefit from the projects shared in this, my homepage.
